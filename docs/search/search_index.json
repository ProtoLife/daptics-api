Classes Class CsvFileEmptyError class CsvFileEmptyError(fname) An error raised if there were no rows that could be read from the specified CSV file. Class CsvNoDataRowsError class CsvNoDataRowsError(fname) An error raised if there were no rows after the header row that could be read from the specified CSV file. Class DapticsClient class DapticsClient(host=None, config=None) A Python GraphQL client for maintaining the state of a Daptics optimization session. Between API invocations, data such as the user id, access token, session id, last generated design, etc. are retained in the object's attributes. host (str): The host part of the API endpoint, as read from configuration, or set manually prior to calling connect . config (str): File path to a JSON configuration file, used to read the host, login credentials and runtime options. Defaults to daptics.conf . The items in the JSON file are: host - host part of the API endpoint user - email of the database user to login with password - password for the database user to login with auto_export_path - see options below auto_generate_next_design - see options below auto_task_timeout - see options below If `config is set to None, configuration can be read from OS environment variables, if they exist. The environment variable names are: DAPTICS_HOST - host part of the API endpoint DAPTICS_USER - email of the database user to login with DAPTICS_PASSWORD - password for the database user to login with DAPTICS_AUTO_EXPORT_PATH - see options below DAPTICS_AUTO_GENERATE_NEXT_DESIGN - see options below DAPTICS_AUTO_TASK_TIMEOUT - see options below options (dict): A Python dict containing runtime options. As of this version, there are three available options: auto_export_path - If not None, a string indicating the relative or absolute directory where the validated experimental space and generated design files will be saved, so that the user will not have to explicitly call the export functions. auto_generate_next_design - If set (True), uploading (initial or later) experiment responses will automatically start a generate task for the next design generation. If not set (None or False), the uploading will only validate the responses, and the user will have to call the generate task manually after a successful validation. auto_task_timeout - If set to a positive number indicating the number of seconds to wait, this option will immediately start to wait on a just-created task, so that the user will not have to explicitly call poll_for_current_task or wait_for_current_task . Setting this option to a negative number, means to wait indefinitely. Setting the option to zero will poll the task just once. The default, None, means that the user wants to explicitly call poll_for_current_task or wait_for_current_task . Class variables Variable DEFAULT_CONFIG The default location for the option configuration file. Variable GET_ANALYTICS_TIMEOUT The default timeout for generating analytics files, in seconds. Variable REQUIRED_SPACE_PARAMS The names of required experimental space parameters. Instance variables Variable api_url The full API endpoint URL.

Variable completed A boolean indicating whether the design space has been completely explored. Variable config The file path to the JSON configuration file used to read the host, login credentials and runtime options. Variable credentials A tuple of ( username , password ), as read from configuration, or set manually prior to calling login . Variable design A Python dict containing the current generated design, as updated by the result of a \"generate\" task. Variable experiments_history A list of Python dict s containing all the experiments and responses that have been simulated, as updated by the result of a \"simulate\" task. Variable gen An integer storing the current design \"generation number\" for the session. This is -1 for a new session, 0 when the session's experimental space has been validated, and greater than zero when a design has been generated by the system. Variable gql The gql.Client object used to make GraphQL requests to the API. Variable host The host part of the API endpoint, as read from configuration, or set manually prior to calling connect . Variable initial_params A Python dict containing the experimental space parameters defaults as initially returned by the create_session method. Variable options A Python dict containing the runtime options. Variable pp A pprint.PrettyPrinter object used for printing Python dict s. Variable remaining If not None, an integer representing the number of possible generations that can be generated until the entire design space has been explored. Variable session_id The session id for a connected Daptics session, as set by the create_session method. Variable session_name The name of the connected Daptics session, as set by the create_session method.

Raises Exception If no data was returned by the query request, an exception is raised, containing the message for the first item in the GraphQL response's errors list. Notes If the task was successfully started, the task information is stored in the client's task_info attribute. If the auto_task_timeout option was set to a positive or negative number, the task will be retried until a result is obtained or the task failed, or the timeout is exceeded. If the \"space\" task completes successfully, the result of the task can be accessed at data['putExperimentalParameters']['result'] . See the documentation on the \"space\" task result in the poll_for_current_task method for information on the CSV file generated if the auto_export_path option is set. These are the required items for the params dict : populationSize (int): The number of experiments per replicate. A positive integer. replicates (int): The number of replicates. A non-negative integer. The total number of experiments per design generation is populationSize * (replicates + 1) . space (dict): The experimental space definition. The required items for the space dict are: type (str): The type of the space, a string, either \"factorial\" or \"mixture\". totalUnits (int): For \"mixture\" type spaces, this is the mixture constraint parameter, a non-negative integer. table (dict): The (optional) column headers and rows of parameter data. See an example below. the colHeaders value is ignored when importing or validating the experimental space definition. To maintain uniformity, header and data row elements should be Python strings, even if they represent numeric values. For \"mixture\" type spaces, there should only be 4 columns of data in each row: the name of the parameter, the type of the parameter (which must always be the string \"unit\"), the minimum value of the parameter (a non-negative integer) and the maximum value of the parameter (a positive integer, less than or equal to the totalUnits constraint parameter). For \"factorial\" type spaces, there must be at least 4 columns of data in each row: the name of the parameter, the type of the parameter (a string, either \"numerical\" or \"categorical\"), and at least two possible distinct values that the parameter can have in an experiment. Different parameters can have either 2 or more than 2 possible values. The rows must be all be of the same size, so make sure to pad the rows with fewer values with empty strings at the end. In addition to the required params listed above, optional additional parameters may be submitted. Please contact daptics for more information about these advanced parameters. Examples Here is a mixture space design that will have enough combinations to be validated by the backend. >>> params = { 'populationSize': 30, 'replicates': 2, 'space': { 'type': 'mixture', 'totalUnits': 25, 'table': { 'colHeaders': [ 'Name', 'Type', 'Min', 'Max' ], 'data': [ [ 'param1', 'unit', '1', '10' ], [ 'param2', 'unit', '2', '10' ], [ 'param3', 'unit', '4', '8' ], [ 'param4', 'unit', '2', '5' ] ] } } } Here is a factorial space design that will have enough combinations to be validated by the backend. >>> params = { 'populationSize': 30, 'replicates': 2, 'space': { 'type': 'factorial', 'table': { 'colHeaders': [ 'Name', 'Type', 'Value.1', 'Value.2', 'Value.3', 'Value.4' ], 'data': [ [ 'param1', 'numerical', '0', '1', '2', '3' ], [ 'param2', 'numerical', '2', '3', '', '' ], [ 'param3', 'numerical', '0', '1', '2', '' ], [ 'param4', 'numerical', '0', '1', '2', '3' ] ] } } } Method put_experimental_parameters_csv def put_experimental_parameters_csv(self, fname, params) Validates the experimental parameters at the beginning of a session, and starts a \"space\" task.

Notes If the task was successfully started, the task information is stored in the client's task_info attribute. If the auto_task_timeout option was set to a positive or negative number, the task will be retried until a result is obtained or the task failed, or the timeout is exceeded. If the \"space\" task completes successfully, the result of the task can be accessed at data['putExperimentalParameters']['result'] . See the documentation on the \"space\" task result in the poll_for_current_task method for information on the CSV file generated if the auto_export_path option is set. Items for the params dict are: populationSize (int): The number of experiments per replicate. A positive integer. replicates (int): The number of replicates. A non-negative integer. The total number of experiments per design generation is populationSize * (replicates + 1) . space (dict): The experimental space definition.

Returns data (dict): The JSON response from the GraphQL request, a Python dict with a putExperiments item. Raises Exception If no data was returned by the query request, an exception is raised, containing the message for the first item in the GraphQL response's errors list. Notes If the experiments were successfully validated, the following actions may be automatically performed: If the auto_export_path option is set, a CSV file of the validated experiments is saved at auto_genN_experiments.csv . If the auto_generate_next_design option is set, a generate task is started, and the task key of the putExperiments key will contain information on the task.

For \"factorial\" type spaces, there must be at least 4 columns of data in each row: the name of the parameter, the type of the parameter (a string, either \"numerical\" or \"categorical\"), and at least two possible distinct values that the parameter can have in an experiment. Different parameters can have either 2 or more than 2 possible values. The rows must be all be of the same size, so make sure to pad the rows with fewer values with empty strings at the end.

If running the cells in the notebook have problems with library imports, see this article for how you might have to import the correct versions of the required requests and gql libraries: https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/installing-python-packages-from-jupyter Tutorial Notebooks This folder contains a series of Jupyter notebooks to explain operation of the daptics API, with explicit examples: 01_README.ipynb 02_Terminology.ipynb 03_SimpleTutorial.ipynb 04_GetAnalytics.ipynb 05_RestartSession.ipynb 06_AutomationWorkflow.ipynb If you are familiar with daptics from the web interface, you could jump directly to 03_SimpleTutorial.ipynb to get started. Make sure to copy all the files in this folder into your Jupyter server directory (the directory from which you start jupyter notebook ), especially the daptics_client.py file that the all notebooks using the daptics API will import. There are also several example experimental space definition CSV files in this folder that you can use to try out different parameters. # Here's an example of using conda to update the required libraries in Jupyter-land. import sys print(sys.path) print('Using {} to run pip'.format(sys.executable)) !{sys.executable} -m pip install requests gql Copyright Notice Daptics API Version 0.9.3 Copyright (c) 2020 Daptics Inc.
