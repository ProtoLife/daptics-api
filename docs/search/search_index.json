DapticsClient DapticsClient(self, host=None, config=None) A Python gql client for maintaining the state of a Daptics optimization session. Between API invocations, data such as the user id, access token, session id, last generated design, etc. are retained in the object's attributes. Attributes host (str) : The host part of the API endpoint, as read from configuration, or set manually prior to calling connect . config (str) : File path to a JSON configuration file, used to read the host, login credentials and runtime options. Defaults to daptics.conf . The keys in the JSON file are : host - host part of the API endpoint user - email of the database user to login with password - password for the database user to login with auto_export_path - see options below auto_generate_next_design - see options below auto_task_timeout - see options below If config is set to None, configuration can be read from OS environment - variables, if they exist. The environment variable names are`: DAPTICS_HOST - host part of the API endpoint DAPTICS_USER - email of the database user to login with DAPTICS_PASSWORD - password for the database user to login with DAPTICS_AUTO_EXPORT_PATH - see options below DAPTICS_AUTO_GENERATE_NEXT_DESIGN - see options below DAPTICS_AUTO_TASK_TIMEOUT - see options below options (dict) : A Python dictionary containing runtime options. As of this version, there are three available options : 'auto_export_path - If not None, a string indicating the relative or absolute directory where the validated experimental space and generated design files will be saved, so that the user will not have to explicitly call the export` functions. auto_generate_next_design - If set (True), uploading (initial or later) experiment responses will automatically start a generate task for the next design generation. If not set (None or False), the uploading will only validate the responses, and the user will have to call the generate task manually after a successful validation. auto_task_timeout - If set to a positive number indicating the number of seconds to wait, this option will immediately start to wait on a just-created task, so that the user will not have to explicitly call poll_for_current_task or wait_for_current_task . Setting this option to a negative number, means to wait indefinitely. Setting the option to zero will poll the task just once. The default, None, means that the user wants to explicitly call poll_for_current_task or wait_for_current_task . credentials : A tuple of ( username , password ), as read from configuration, or set manually prior to calling login . api_url (str) : The full API endpoint URL. pp (pprint.PrettyPrinter) : Used for printing dict output. gql (gql.Client) : The gql.Client object used to make GraphQL requests to the API. auth (TokenAuth) : Used to insert the required authorization header in API requests.

This is -1 for a new session, 0 when the session's experimental space has been validated, and greater than zero when a design has been generated by the system. remaining (int) : If not None, the number of possible generations that can be generated until the entire design space has been explored. completed (boolean) : A flag indicating whether the design space has been completely explored. initial_params (dict) : The experimental space and other information as initially returned by the create_session method. space (dict) : The experimental space as updated by the result of the \"save experimental space\" task. design (dict) : The current generated design, as updated by the result of a \"generate design\" task. experiments_history (list) : All the experiments and responses that have been simulated, as updated by the result of a \"simulate\" task, represented as a list of Python dicts. print DapticsClient.print(self) Print out debugging information about the session. call_api DapticsClient.call_api(self, document, vars, timeout=None) Perform validation on the gql query or mutation document and then execute the query. We cannot call self.gql.execute directly, because it converts 'errors' returned into an Exception. We want to preserve the 'errors' if they exist, and also return the data. Arguments fname (str) : The file path to save the client state to. Returns (dict, dict) : A tuple containing two dicts `: The first element is the data component of the GraphQL response, a Python dict with currentTask , and the second element is the errors component of the GraphQL response.

If you wish to submit calibrating or existing experimental responses prior to the first design generartion, use INITIAL_EXTRAS_ONLY . If you are submitting the responses for a daptics-generated design, along with any extra experiments, use DESIGNED_WITH_OPTIONAL_EXTRAS . If you wish to submit any final extra experiments when you are satisified with the session's optimization but do not want to include the last generated experimental design use FINAL_EXTRAS_ONLY . Note that this will end the session's optimization and that no more designs will be generated. experiments (dict) : A \"table\" of experiments that includes columns, defined in the colHeaders value of the table, for each of the defined space parameters, and a column named 'Response' to record the result of experiments. Each row in the data value for the table represents an individual experiment.
