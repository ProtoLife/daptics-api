Class CsvNoDataRowsError class CsvNoDataRowsError(fname) Common base class for all non-exit exceptions. Class DapticsClient class DapticsClient(host=None, config=None) A Python gql client for maintaining the state of a Daptics optimization session. Between API invocations, data such as the user id, access token, session id, last generated design, etc. are retained in the object's attributes. host (str): The host part of the API endpoint, as read from configuration, or set manually prior to calling connect . config (str): File path to a JSON configuration file, used to read the host, login credentials and runtime options. Defaults to daptics.conf . The keys in the JSON file are: host - host part of the API endpoint user - email of the database user to login with password - password for the database user to login with auto_export_path - see options below auto_generate_next_design - see options below auto_task_timeout - see options below If `config is set to None, configuration can be read from OS environment variables, if they exist. The environment variable names are: DAPTICS_HOST - host part of the API endpoint DAPTICS_USER - email of the database user to login with DAPTICS_PASSWORD - password for the database user to login with DAPTICS_AUTO_EXPORT_PATH - see options below DAPTICS_AUTO_GENERATE_NEXT_DESIGN - see options below DAPTICS_AUTO_TASK_TIMEOUT - see options below options (dict): A Python dict containing runtime options. As of this version, there are three available options: 'auto_export_path - If not None, a string indicating the relative or absolute directory where the validated experimental space and generated design files will be saved, so that the user will not have to explicitly call the export` functions. auto_generate_next_design - If set (True), uploading (initial or later) experiment responses will automatically start a generate task for the next design generation. If not set (None or False), the uploading will only validate the responses, and the user will have to call the generate task manually after a successful validation. auto_task_timeout - If set to a positive number indicating the number of seconds to wait, this option will immediately start to wait on a just-created task, so that the user will not have to explicitly call poll_for_current_task or wait_for_current_task . Setting this option to a negative number, means to wait indefinitely. Setting the option to zero will poll the task just once. The default, None, means that the user wants to explicitly call poll_for_current_task or wait_for_current_task . Class variables Variable DEFAULT_CONFIG The default location for the option configuration file. Variable GET_ANALYTICS_TIMEOUT The default timeout for generating analytics files, in seconds. Variable REQUIRED_SPACE_PARAMS The names of required experimental space parameters. Instance variables Variable api_url The full API endpoint URL.

Variable completed A boolean indicating whether the design space has been completely explored. Variable config The file path to the JSON configuration file used to read the host, login credentials and runtime options. Variable credentials A tuple of ( username , password ), as read from configuration, or set manually prior to calling login . Variable design A Python dict contining the current generated design, as updated by the result of a \"generate\" task. Variable experiments_history A list of Python dict s containing all the experiments and responses that have been simulated, as updated by the result of a \"simulate\" task. Variable gen An integer storing the current design \"generation number\" for the session. This is -1 for a new session, 0 when the session's experimental space has been validated, and greater than zero when a design has been generated by the system. Variable gql The gql.Client object used to make GraphQL requests to the API. Variable host The host part of the API endpoint, as read from configuration, or set manually prior to calling connect . Variable initial_params A Python dict containing the experimental space parameters defaults as initially returned by the create_session method. Variable options A Python dict containing the runtime options. Variable pp A pprint.PrettyPrinter object used for printing Python dict s. Variable remaining If not None, an integer representing the number of possible generations that can be generated until the entire design space has been explored. Variable session_id The session id for a connected PDT session, as set by the create_session method. Variable task_info A Python dict that holds information about the polling status for running tasks in the session. Variable user_id The user id for the authenticated user, set by the login method. Variable validated_params A Python dict containing the experimental space parameters as updated from the result of a \"space\" task.

See an example below. the colHeaders value is ignored when importing or validating the experimental space definition. To maintain uniformity, header and data row elements should be Python strings, even if they represent numeric values. For mixture type spaces, there should only be 4 columns of data in each row: the name of the parameter, the type of the parameter (which must always be the string \"unit\"), the minimum value of the parameter (a non-negative integer) and the maximum value of the parameter (a positive integer, less than or equal to the totalUnits constraint parameter). For factorial type spaces, there must be at least 4 columns of data in each row: the name of the parameter, the type of the parameter (a string, either \"numerical\" or \"categorical\"), and at least two possible distinct values that the parameter can have in an experiment. Different parameters can have either 2 or more than 2 possible values. The rows must be all be of the same size, so make sure to pad the rows with fewer values with empty strings at the end. In addition to the required params listed above, optional additional parameters may be submitted. Please contact daptics for more information about these advanced parameters.

The individual experimental parameter names, types and permissible values in the space definition are read from a CSV file. Arguments fname (str): The location on the filesystem for a CSV file that will define the experimental space definition. See the Examples section below for an example. params (dict): A Python dict containing the experimental parameters to be used for the session. See the Notes section for more information. Returns dict: The JSON response from the gql request, a Python dict with putExperimentalParameters and/or errors keys. If the task was successfully started, the task information is stored in the client's task_info attribute. Also, if the auto_task_timeout option was set to a positive or negative number, the task will be retried until a result is obtained or the task failed, or the timeout is exceeded. Raises csv.Error: If the specified CSV file is incorrectly formatted. Notes Keys for the params dict are: populationSize (int): The number of experiments per replicate. A positive integer. replicates (int): The number of replicates. A non-negative integer. The total number of experiments per design generation is populationSize * (replicates + 1) . space (dict): The experimental space definition. The single required key for the space dict is: type (str): factorial or mixture In addition to the required params listed above, optional additional parameters may be submitted. Please contact daptics for more information about these advanced parameters. Examples Here is a space design that will have enough combinations to be validated by the backend. >>> params = { 'populationSize': 30, 'replicates': 2, 'space': { 'type': 'factorial', } } The contents of an example CSV file for a factorial space might be: param1,numerical,0,1,2,3 param2,numerical,2,3,4, param3,numerical,0,1,, param4,numerical,0,1,2,3 Each parameter row in a factorial space definition should have the same number of columns. Parameter rows with fewer than the maximum number of values should have the empty columns at the end of the row, as shown above. The contents of an example CSV file for a mixture space might be: param1,unit,0,10 param2,unit,5,10 param3,unit,0,10 param4,unit,0,5 Each parameter fow in a mixture space defintion must specify a minimum and maximum unit volume, as shown above. Do not supply a header row for the space definition (for any type), just the parameter rows. Method put_experiments def put_experiments(self, experiments_type, experiments) Validate the responses for designed experiments, and any extra experiments for the current generation in the session. This method, or the put_experiments_responses_csv method, must be called before generating the next design, or finalizing the campaign. Arguments experiments_type (DapticsExperimentsType): Describes the types of experiments that are being added to the session. If you wish to submit calibrating or existing experimental responses prior to the first design generartion, use INITIAL_EXTRAS_ONLY . If you are submitting the responses for a daptics-generated design, along with any extra experiments, use DESIGNED_WITH_OPTIONAL_EXTRAS . If you wish to submit any final extra experiments when you are satisified with the session's optimization but do not want to include the last generated experimental design use FINAL_EXTRAS_ONLY . Note that this will end the session's optimization and that no more designs will be generated. experiments (dict): A \"table\" of experiments that includes columns, defined in the colHeaders value of the table, for each of the defined space parameters, and a column named 'Response' to record the result of experiments. Each row in the data value for the table represents an individual experiment. If the experiments type is DESIGNED_WITH_OPTIONAL_EXTRAS , you must sumbit at least as many rows as exist in the currently generated design, and the parameter values for these rows must match the design exactly. Additional \"extra\" experiment rows, that use any valid experimental parameter values, can also be provided. For the INITIAL_EXTRAS_ONLY and FINAL_EXTRAS_ONLY experiments types, rows that use any valid experimental parameter values can be provided. Returns dict: The JSON response from the gql request, a Python dict with putExperiments and/or errors keys. If the experiments were successfully validated, the following actions may be automatically performed: If the auto_export_path option is set, a CSV file of the validated experiments is saved at auto_genN_experiments.csv . If the auto_generate_next_design option is set, a generate task is started, and the task key of the putExperiments key will contain information on the task. If the auto_generate_next_design AND auto_task_timeout options are set, this method will block as the task is polled until it succeeds, fails, or the timeout value is exceeded. Examples Here's an expamle of an experiments table: >>> experiments = { 'colHeaders': ['param1', 'param2', 'param3', 'param4', 'Response'], 'data': [ ['0', '4', '1', '1', '3.25'], ['1', '4', '1', '1', '4.5'], ... etc, matching generated design rows ] } Method put_experiments_csv def put_experiments_csv(self, experiments_type, fname) Validate the responses for designed experiments, and any extra experiments for the current generation in the session.

If you wish to submit any final extra experiments when you are satisified with the session's optimization but do not want to include the last generated experimental design use FINAL_EXTRAS_ONLY . Note that this will end the session's optimization and that no more designs will be generated. fname (str): The location on the filesystem for a CSV file that will define the results of the designed and any extra experiments. See the Examples section below for an example. Returns dict: The JSON response from the gql request, a Python dict with putExperiments and/or errors keys. If the experiments were successfully validated, the following actions may be automatically performed: If the auto_export_path option is set, a CSV file of the validated experiments is saved at auto_genN_experiments.csv . If the auto_generate_next_design option is set, a generate task is started, and the task key of the putExperiments key will contain information on the task. If the auto_generate_next_design AND auto_task_timeout options are set, this method will block as the task is polled until it succeeds, fails, or the timeout value is exceeded.
