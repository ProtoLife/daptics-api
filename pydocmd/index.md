# Daptics API Index<a class="tocSkip"></a>

This is the index page for documentation about the daptics API
and about the daptics API Python client. The daptics API exposes
all the functionality of the [Daptics web interface](https://daptics.ai),
allowing you to incorporate daptics' machine learning algorithms
to optimize the design of complex experiments.

You can read more about the daptics system in our
[overview white paper](https://daptics.ai/pdt_overview). Other
information is also available at that website.

The currently released version of this page is hosted on GitHub Pages at
[https://ProtoLife.github.io/daptics-api](https://ProtoLife.github.io/daptics-api)


## Daptics API Resources

The [daptics-api GitHub repository](https://github.com/ProtoLife/daptics-api)
contains the following public resources in the `python_client` folder for you
to download, examine and use:

1. The `daptics_client` Python API client package exposes the `DapticsClient` class,
that allows you to create or connect to a session, set up your experimental
space, generate optimized experiments, and obtain analytics results.

2. There are six interactive Jupyter notebooks in `.ipynb` files that
provide how-tos on installation, explanations of the terminology used by
daptics, and tutorials that explore design of experiments solutions
using the Python API client package.


## Documentation

Visit the
[Python API Client](./daptics_client/)
link for descriptions of the classes and methods exposed by the `daptics_client` Python module.

Visit the
[Daptics GraphQL API](./graphql_api/)
link for descriptions of all the objects available in the low-level GraphQL API.


## Setup and Installation

To use the daptics API, you must first sign up by clicking on the
**Get Started For Free** button on the daptics home page at
[https://daptics.ai](https://daptics.ai)

Please contact [support@daptics.ai](mailto:support@daptics.ai)
if you need assistance setting up a daptics account.

Visit the
[Jupyter Notebooks](./jupyter_notebooks/)
link for instructions on how you can set up a local Jupyter Notebook server
if you do not have access to a server that can open `.ipynb` files.
