    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before opening the Introduction notebook, install IPython, Jupyter and required packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) with conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge requests gql ipython jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or b) with pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# first, always upgrade pip!\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "pip install --upgrade requests gql ipython jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the notebook in the tutorial directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd python_client\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then open the Introduction.ipynb notebook. If running the cells in the notebook have\n",
    "problems with library imports, see this article for how you might have to import the\n",
    "correct versions of the required `requests` and `gql` libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/installing-python-packages-from-jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorials folder contains a series of jupyter notebooks to explain operation of the daptics API, with explicit examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 01_README.ipynb\n",
    "* 02_Terminology.ipynb\n",
    "* 03_SimpleTutorial.ipynb\n",
    "* 03_SimpleTutorial_.ipynb\n",
    "* 04_GetAnalytics.ipynb\n",
    "* 05_RestartSession.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with Daptics from the web interface, you could jump directly to `03_SimpleTutorial.ipynb` to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to copy all the files in this folder into your\n",
    "Jupyter server directory (the directory from which you start `jupyter notebook`), especially the daptics_client.py file that the all notebooks using the daptics API  will import.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several example experimental space definition CSV files in this\n",
    "folder that you can use to try out different parameters."
